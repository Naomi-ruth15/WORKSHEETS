## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r r_data <- data.frame(respondents, sex, fathers_occupation,persons_at_home, siblings_at_school,types_of_houses)}
r_data
```
```{r siblings_at_school <- c(6, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2)}
mean(siblings_at_school)
```


```{r new_data <- r_data(c(3,5),c(2,4))}
new_data
```
```{r types_houses <- types_of_houses}
types_houses
```
```{r male_data <- data.frame(sex, fathers_occupation)subset(male_data, sex == 1 & fathers_occupation == 1)}
print(male_data)
```
```{r girl_data <- data.frame(sex, siblings_at_school) subset(girl_data, sex == 2 & siblings_at_school >= 5)}
print(girl_data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
